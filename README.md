# Custom Logging added to HttpClient for Coded Workflows

This project uses coded workflows and Studio 24.10.x <br>
The purpose is to create a modified version of HttpClient where it logs details using the robot logs. <br>
Those logs will show in Orchestrator/Insights and can be used for further monitoring. <br>
